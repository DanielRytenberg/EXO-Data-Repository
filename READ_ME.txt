The rows 7-14 are the variables you could change and the script still runes.

To run the scrip:
	First open Wavegen and Scope
	Change the varaibels as you please on the rows 7 - 14
	Run the script for a few seconds and then press "Abort". This is because the Scope takes two runns to fully change it's variables. Idk why but it is what it is.
	Afterwards run the script.

Notes:
	Let the file "DataIndex.txt" start with 100 and not 001. This is because the script will be smart and se the file as integers and not as a text file. This leas all the 
	zeros before an value is removed.
